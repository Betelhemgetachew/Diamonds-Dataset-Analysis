# Diamonds-Dataset-Analysis
## About
This project explores the Diamonds dataset, which contains nearly 54,000 round-cut diamonds, focusing on their prices and key attributes. The analysis utilizes data visualization and descriptive statistics to uncover relationships between variables, providing insights into the factors influencing diamond prices.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to understand the factors affecting diamond prices by examining the relationships between carat weight, cut quality, clarity, and color. Through statistical summaries and visualizations, we aim to gain insights into pricing trends in the diamond market.

## Description of the Data Structure and Variables
The Diamonds dataset includes the following ten variables:

- carat - Weight of the diamond (0.2–5.01)
- cut - Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- price - Price in US dollars ($326–$18,823)
- color - Diamond color, ranging from D (best) to J (worst)
- clarity - Clarity measurement (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
- x - Length in mm (0–10.74)
- y - Width in mm (0–58.9)
- z - Depth in mm (0–31.8)
- depth - Total depth percentage, the ratio of depth to the average diameter of the diamond
- table - Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point (43–95)
The dataset consists of 53,940 rows and 10 columns, featuring variables of different types, including numeric, integer, ordinal, and categorical.

## Tools and Visualizations
The following tools and types of visualizations were used in this analysis:

### Tools:

- R programming language
- ggplot2 package (part of the Tidyverse)  
### Types of Visualizations:

- Scatter plots  
- Bar charts 
- Frequency distribution plots
